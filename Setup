#Necessary imports
from machine import Pin, ADC, PWM
import time


#Setting up PWM

#Set up PWM outputs
'''set to 0 and 1'''


# Set PWM frequency
'''frequencies for both set to 1000'''

#Hardware interface
# Set up ADC for the knobs. Also mapped to LEDs so knob 1 corresponds to LED1 (GP16) and knob 2 corresponds to LED2 (GP17)

knob1 = ADC(Pin(27))
knob2 = ADC(Pin(26))
button = Pin(11, Pin.OUT)

#Code for GP26 and GP27 can be found in II - Managing the reading of X and Y potentiometer inputs

#Code for GP11 can be found in III - Implementing the pen's up/down control based on the switch input
